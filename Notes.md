This about how I would convert an array to its like value
adding numbers to each value

ex:
	eachLike({name: 'July'}, 3)
when asked for its like value would print
	[
		{name: 'July_01'},
		{name: 'July_02'}
	]

simple should be able to convert strings, number objects or arrays, write more test cases
